    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        In the Philippines, which was claimed by the Spanish in 1521, adobo is most often a braise featuring vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves,and black peppercorns—the ratio of which is 
        dictated by both your family’s palate and your own. While I might like my chicken adobo saucy and more savory than sour, my cousin might want theirs slightly sweet and reduced into a sticky glaze; 
        another cousin might go for pork, not chicken, because anything can become adobo, even squid, eggplant, or mushrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Considered by many to be the national dish of the Philippines, adobo reflects the regionality of the archipelago’s 7,640 islands. In some regions, coconut milk is added for adobo sa gata, and not all 
        adobos even contain soy sauce. It might be replaced with fish sauce and annatto to make adobong pula (red adobo), with turmeric to make adobong dilaw (yellow adobo), or skipped entirely for adobong puti (white adobo).

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs /1.5 kilos pieces of Chicken or one whole chicken, cut-up or a combo of Chicken and Pork</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white Vinegar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Water</li>
        <li>1/3 up to 1/2 cup Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>1 Whole Garlic cloves separated, crushed, but left unpeeled</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons whole Black Peppercorns</li>
        <li>3 Bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon brown Sugar optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps in Cooking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the meat and the rest of the ingredients in a large pan like a Dutch oven. You can also marinate the meat overnight prior to cooking.</li>
        <li>Using medium heat, bring to a boil. Adjust the heat to the lowest setting and cook uncovered for 20 minutes. This helps mellow the taste of the vinegar.</li>
        <li>Cover and then continue to simmer on low until the chicken (and pork) pieces are tender about 30-40 minutes. When the meat is already tender, sprinkle the brown sugar on top. Gently stir to allow sugar to be absorbed 
            by the meat. Cover and cook for another 2-3 minutes. This will not really sweeten the adobo but just help enhance the flavor and add a little caramel glaze to the meat. The adobo is already yummy at this time but its 
            taste improves as it ages. And don’t forget the rice – lots of rice as this is a particulary more-ish dish.
