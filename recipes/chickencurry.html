    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Filipino Chicken Curry is a creamy dish similar to Ginataang Manok, using coconut milk but seasoned with a mild, turmeric-rich curry powder. Unlike Kare-Kare, known for its peanut sauce, this curry gets 
        its flavor and yellow color from the curry powder. It’s filled with hearty vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and bell peppers, and the addition of fish sauce gives it a distinct taste.
